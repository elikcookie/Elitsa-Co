                <p>
                    Hamster Care 101 is a website that provides users with a comprehensive <br>information that will
                    help
                    them learn more about hamsters, decide whether or not they should get a hamster and all the cost
                    and
                    care involved. <br>There is basic info on each hamster breed, a blog page with blog posts that
                    provide
                    information on different hamster topics, a hamster care page with videos and information about a
                    hamsters basic needs <br>and a cost calculator to help users decide whether they can afford a
                    hamster
                    <br><br>
                    Ø Describe the archetypical users of the site.
                    <br><br>
                    The archetypical users of the site are people above 12 who are interested and caring for
                    hamsters as pets and need more information.
                    <br><br>
                    Ø What problem does the site solve?
                    Hamsters tend to be under cared for and even abused because they are sold for cheap.<br>
                    My website provides easy to access info on hamsters and will hopefully encourage hamster owners to
                    <br>
                    care better for their pets.

            <p>
                Ø Evaluate the site layout and site content.
                <br><br>
                Ø You must look at 3 websites as part of your research.

                    alt="Screenshot of the Hamster Guru Blog Page">
                <br>The first website I researched was Hamster Guru (https://hamsterguru.com/blog/)<br>
                <br>The way the blog posts are layed out is very similar to mine and is an exact representation of
                the
                layout I was going for for the blog page.
                It provies similar information to my website however it's diffucult to navigate and it is not visually
                appealing

                <br><br>
                <img class="screenshot" src="assets/images/erinsAnimals.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of the home Page of Erin Animals">
                <br>The second website I researched is called Erin Animals and it was made with wix.com
                (https://erinshamsters.wixsite.com/hamsters). The website has a lot of useful information on hamsters,
                however it's unresponsive and looks outdated.

                    alt="Screenshot of Hamster Society Singapore ">
                <br>The third website I researched is called Hamster Society Singapore
                (https://www.hamstersociety.sg/hamstercareblog). I really like the layout of it, it looks really clean,
                but it was made using squrespace which is a bit lazy.

                <h2>Technology Selection and Site Architecture (20%)</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Version of HTML/CSS to be used - HTML5 and CSS3
                    <br>
                    Ø Plan for site layout and responsive design.
                    <br><br>
                    My plan for the site layout is using a lot of div elemets called col for collum and row for a row to
                    structure it.
                    I will first write up all the html and the css then add JavaScript. <br>
                    I will be testing the website as I make it to make sure it looks good on phone, tablets and desktops
                    and
                    I will be styling certain elements with media queries to make sure its responsive.<br>
                    The site will contain 5 main pages, a home page, hamster breeds page, hamster care page, a blog page
                    and a report page.
                    Additional 3 blog post pages will be added as well as a seperate contact page.<br>
                    The 5 main pages will be laid out in the top navigation bar, or the drop down menu on smaller
                    devices ,
                    and the additional pages will be able to be accessed from either the blog for the blog post pages or
                    the footer for the contact page.

                    Ø How do we expect users to view the site (Phone/tablet/PC etc...)?
                    <br><br>
                    The users are mainly expected to view this website on a PC or a phone however the website is also
                    repsponsive on tablets.
                    Ø Cross Browser Compatibility strategy?
                    <br><br>
                    I will run the website on 3 different browsers, chrome,
                    safari and firefox to check for compatibility. I will be checking all the pages on each browser and
                    see if its responsive<br>

                    <p>
                        The website looks exactly the same on Safari as it does on Chrome, one small difference
                        it how the drop-down selection looks on the blog posts page but it is not a major aesthetic
                        disaster.

            </h2>
            <hr>
            I have used JavaScript in a few different ways to make my website functional.<br><br>
            <ol>
                <li>I made a base carousel using JavaScript which then I used for the breeds page to show
                    all 5 hamster breeds on a different slide, you can also click on the
                    images of the breeds to move the slide position to the selected breed.<br>
                    I also used the carousel for the hamster care page to show videos to related topics.<br>
                    A carousel can also be found on the home page to show the most recent posts.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    I used JavaScript in the Hamster Care page for the calculator.<br>
                    It gets input from the user and calculates how much would hamster csre cost for that person.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    I used JavaScript in the contact form so it shows error messages when
                    the user doesn't enter their name/enters an invalid email/don't enter a message
                    and it clears the messages once the user fullfiles the requirement.<br>
                    Upon successful completion a pop up Success window shows.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    I used JavaScript for the toggle menu.
                    <br>When the website is viewed on smaller devices a menu icon appers and when you click it there
                    is a drop down menu.

                        One potential error is the youtube iframes not working due to the videos getting deleted or
                        taken down. This can be solved by using original videos that are saved in the aseets folder
                        instead of iframes.

                    All the pages will have the same navigation bar and footer, therefore they will share the same css
                    for that.<br>
                    All the titles and texts on all the pages are styled the same.<br>
                    The carousel share the same css styling, except for the hamster breeds carousel which has some extra
                    styles.<br>
                    A similar color pallete is used troughout the website for consistancy.

                    I checked every html page using the The Nu Html Checker (https://validator.w3.org/nu/) for my HTMl
                    validation. I checked every page and corrected every warning and error so my website is valid.
                    <br><br>
                    I used the W3C CSS validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my CSS file and
                    corrected any errors.

                    Ø Is the site Responsive? Test screenshots from Chrome Developer must be included in this section.
                    <br><br>
                    Yes the site is responsive, here are some screenshots that show all the website pages being
                    responsive.

                        All links are titled, as well as all pages so the user can see exactly where they are.

                        My website is following the common website standards,
                        every function of the website is made to be similar to other websites so the user would

                        One potential error is the youtube iframes not working due to the videos getting deleted or
                        taken down. This can be solved by using original videos that are saved in the aseets folder
                        instead of iframes.
